- DoorManager

Use Esp8266 and Stm32F103C8T6 to open the door by Android app or NFC id card. Using STM32 , makes my system stable ! Never use ESP8266 and Arduino to meet complex needs 

- LightOnDesk

WS2812 lights on my desk, I can control the R G B by my code using the encoder or botton

- NFC

Old project , only using esp8266 to control motor and receive mqtt and NFC messages , which is unstable and unsafe

- NFC_Door

Old project , same with the last , but use a better libaray about nfc , though it is unstable too
